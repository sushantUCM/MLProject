# MLProject

Text classification is the process of classifying a text material into a number of predetermined categories or tags. It is a key problem in NLP and has uses in a number of areas, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and spam filtering. The requirement for precise and effective text classification has expanded quickly with the growth of digital text data. Many different algorithms have been presented, and machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated promising results in text classification. Yet, choosing the best method and its optimal parameters for a given problem is not an easy task. To determine the most effective method, empirical evaluation of various ML algorithms for text classification is required.


## Objectives:
The main objective of this research is to conduct an empirical evaluation of different machine learning algorithms for text classification. Specifically, the research will aim to:
Evaluate the effectiveness of various text classification machine learning techniques.
Choose the machine learning algorithm with the best accuracy, productivity, and scalability for classifying text.
Examine the effects of various feature selection and extraction methods on the effectiveness of text categorization machine learning systems.


## Methodology:
The research will be conducted in the following steps:
Dataset collection and preprocessing: The preprocessing of a sizable dataset of text documents will take place. Tokenization, stemming, and cleaning are all part of the preprocessing.
A 20 Newsgroups dataset, which includes over 20,000 newsgroup posts from 20 separate newsgroups, will serve as the basis for this study. As each post is assigned to one of the 20 newsgroups, text categorization tasks may be performed on it.
In a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, we will divide the dataset into 10 equal-sized sections at random. Then, after training each ML method on nine of the subsets, we will assess its performance on the final subset. This procedure will be repeated ten times, allowing us to test each subset just once. As performance measurements, we'll employ F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision.
Feature selection and extraction: Different feature selection and extraction techniques, such as:
bag-of-words
n-grams 
term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) 
will be applied to the preprocessed dataset to extract meaningful features.
Machine learning algorithm selection: Different machine learning algorithms: 
Logistic Regression - statistical method used for binary classification problems
Support Vector Machines (SVM) - linear model that works well in high-dimensional spaces.
Naïve Bayes - probabilistic model that relies on Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of a given input belonging to a particular class.
K-Nearest Neighbors – Method to classify based on the least distance of an instance to predefined outcomes.
Decision Trees - tree-like model where each internal node represents a decision rule based on a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label. Each feature can be represented as each word, typically using bag-of-words extraction method.
Random Forest - Random forests are based on decision trees, but instead of using a single decision tree, they use a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different random subset of the input features and training data.
will be evaluated for text classification for modern classification problems.
The proposal focuses more on supervised learning techniques, as it will be mainly experimenting with already known(labeled) outcomes. Evaluation will be more concise as compared to Unsupervised or Semi Supervised learning techniques. 
The proposal is not considering Deep Learning techniques such as CNN or RNN based classification.
All algorithms to be tested will contain certain parameters which will give an optimal performance. This performance tuning can be done using Grid Search and experimenting with different parameters.
Evaluation metrics: The performance of different machine learning algorithms will be evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as 
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances over the total number of instances.
Precision: The proportion of true positives (correctly classified instances) over the total number of instances classified as positive.
Recall: The proportion of true positives over the total number of actual positives.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Statistical analysis: To assess the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms and determine which is best for text classification, a statistical study will be conducted.
Visualization: The results will be visualized to show the comparison between the different algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
